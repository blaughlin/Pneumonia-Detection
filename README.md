# Pneumonia Detection with Deep Learning!
Deep learning for pneumonia detection 

## Overview
This project applies deep learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using fine-tuned ResNet50, DenseNet121, and a custom CNN model trained from scratch. The goal was to compare transfer learning vs. training a CNN from scratch and identify the best model for clinical deployment.

Through extensive experiments, ResNet50 emerged as the best-performing model, achieving high precision and the lowest false alarm rate, making it ideal for real-world medical applications.
